# Contributing

So, you want to help improve this extension? That is fantastic, you are a _wonderful_ person, thank you! Given that I this is a
spare-time project, and I'm fully employed, I can use all the help I can get.

## Bugs and Feature Requests
1. Report bugs in the [Issues](https://github.com/malware-dev/MDK-SE/issues) section. Please explain your bugs as best you can. The best    way is to write steps-to-reproduce (STR) which explains step by step how to make the bug happen. Bugs without such a reproduction might not be fixable. If your bug is a crash, please include a Visual Studio log with the crash. [See this page](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/ide/reference/log-devenv-exe) for information on how to enable the Visual Studio log.  

2. Ask for features in the [Issues](https://github.com/malware-dev/MDK-SE/issues) section too. Keep in mind that while I personally cannot add everything - I have to constrain my own workload around features I myself will have a use for - perhaps there's another kind person who will be able to add it?  

3. Give _productive_ feedback. Read the [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/malware-dev/MDK-SE/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) and adhere to it. Remember I'm not selling you anything, I don't owe you anything. Whether you use my product is completely up to you. Meaning; if you're rude your post will quite simply be ignored.

## Pull Requests
Since I cannot possibly do everything myself, I will certainly accept pull requests - but I must ask that you follow a few ground rules. This is so I can keep control of the repository, and to help prevent you wasting your time on work that I will reject. [See this video](https://youtu.be/J_bLNULs7Ck) for a description on how to set up Visual Studio for contribution.

1. **Remember that many users will be inexperienced both with IDEs and coding**. It's very important that your feature is easy to use.  

2. Please _ask me_ before starting work on a larger contribution. I have the final say in what I want added. Remember, this is still a project I actually made for my _own_ use. I can tell you if what you want to add will be rejected outright and I really don't want you to waste your time, it's too valuable for me. You can either ask via an [Issue](https://github.com/malware-dev/MDK-SE/issues) or you can try reaching me at [Keen's official Discord](https://discord.gg/keenswh).  

3. I recommend not trying to do a pull request unless you already have a bit of experience in coding. Visual Studio is not a forgiving application to extend. This isn't any kind of requirement though, if your addition isn't too large you might get some help finishing.  

4. Remember that I will have to review your work. Anything you can do to help that process will be appreciated.  

5. Expect criticism.  

6. Read the [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/malware-dev/MDK-SE/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) and adhere to it.
